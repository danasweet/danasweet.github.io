  <h3 class="blogsubtitle">how my personal values led me to DBC</h3>
  <p id="date">august 20, 2015</p>

  <p class="body">
    As Phase 0 is wrapping up, in addition to anxiously looking forward to what's ahead, I'm finding myself in a state of reflection. The past year has been a transformative experience for me personally, as I've left behind a perfectly comfortable life and embarked on a journey in search of discovering nothing more than how happy one can be.
  </p>
  <p class="body">
    As I get older and each year seems to pass faster than the last, I've become painfully aware of the fact that my time on this Earth is very limited. I'm passionate about maximizing my happiness and making the most of my life, and this idea has permeated nearly every decision I've made in the last year. Selling everything I own, roadtripping around the country, exploring Asia, and drastically shifting careers are my attempt to derive as much pleasure as possible from my brief existence.
  </p>
  <p class="body">
    When I consider the times in my life that I've been the happiest, more often than not those feelings arose from a sense of freedom, adventure, connecting with nature, and independence. Nothing beats knowing that the world is my oyster, feeling at peace with being alone, and venturing outside my comfort zone to see and experience as much of the world as I can.
  </p>
  <p class="body">
    Throughout this journey, I've been admired from afar by others who wish they could throw up their hands and start down a new path as well. The truth is, most people could. It takes a lot of courage to quit a perfectly good job, to leave a city you love, to lob your life savings at a goal, or to do all of the above, if that's the case. But what's the alternative? Your life will remain mundane. Someday you'll wake up and discover that 30 years have passed and nothing's changed. All the excitement is gone; there are no more surprises to be had. This is my greatest fear.
  </p>
  <p class="body">
    I think remembering these ideals and my reasons for entering Dev Bootcamp will help motivate me and lift me up while I'm struggling through the next several weeks. I didn't sign up for this program on a whim, and it's not a backup plan. My participation is the result of over a year of self-reflection and chasing the dream: to find fulfillment in my career and in my life.
  </p>
  <p class="body">
    I'll leave you with a quote that I find infinitely inspiring:<br>
    <span class="italic">"Make a radical change in your lifestyle and begin to boldly do things which you may previously never have thought of doing, or been too hesitant to attempt. So many people live within unhappy circumstances and yet will not take the initiative to change their situation because they are conditioned to a life of security, conformity, and conservation, all of which may appear to give one peace of mind, but in reality nothing is more damaging to the adventurous spirit within a man than a secure future. The very basic core of a man's living spirit is his passion for adventure. The joy of life comes from our encounters with new experiences."</span>  --Jon Krakauer, Into The Wild
