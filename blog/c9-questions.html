  <h2 class="blogtitle">i got 99 questions</h2>
  <h3 class="blogsubtitle">all of which are specific, succinct, and grammatically correct</h3>

  <p class="body">
    Things I'm expecting not to have during Phase 1: free time, a stocked refrigerator, confidence in my coding abilities, a boyfriend. What I <span class="italic">do</span> expect to have a lot of during Phase 1: questions. Having questions is an important part of learning, and asking good questions will lead to better answers and ultimately a stronger grasp of the material. So what makes a good question?
  </p>
  <p class="body">
    For me, the most important aspect of a good question is specificity. Simply stating, "I'm confused," is not enough context for someone to help you. You should be able to clearly state your problem and what you don't understand. Refer to specific lines of code where possible. Describe the errors you're getting. Explain what you thought would happen and what's happening instead. Vague questions will get you vague answers.
  </p>
  <p class="body">
    While being specific is important, so is being succinct. No one likes a rambler. If you're posting your question on a forum, people will pass it without reading. In person, don't be surprised if you get interrupted or asked to get to the point. In fact, a verbose question can be even more confusing than a vague one. Try to give just enough information to be helpful, but leave out the irrelevant details.
  </p>
  <p class="body">
    This last part is for written questions only: for the love of god, proofread! Spelling, grammar, and punctuation are important both in effectively communicating your question, and in life. Reread your question before you post it, and pretend like you're seeing it for the first time. Does it make sense? Have you included all necessary information? Would you answer the question if you saw it being asked?
  </p>
  <p class="body">
    Great, so we're professional question askers. Now what? Well, now we must conquer our fear of looking stupid and start actually asking the questions. &#x1f648; That's a whole 'nother blog post, y'all.
