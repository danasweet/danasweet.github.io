    How do I feel about taking on Dev Bootcamp?
  </p>
  <p class="body">
    Terrified. Hopeful. Anxious. Proud. Eager. Apprehensive. Relieved. Enthusiastic.
  </p>
  <p class="body">
    In short: so freakin' thrilled. My future looks bright. For the first time in years, I have a sense of direction. I'm excited about this new career path, and especially stoked to jumpstart it at DBC. I can't wait to learn a buncha new skills and make a buncha new friends.
  </p>
  <p class="body">
    In doing my bootcamp research, DBC was constantly emerging as a strong choice because of the emphasis put on mind, body, and spirit well-being, in addition to the general curriculum. This differentiation is important for me, because Dev Bootcamp is only one stretch of path on a much longer journey to self-improvement. When I looked at my life and realized I was not as happy or fulfilled as I could be, I decided to do something about it. In order to stay motivated and sure of my way, I feel it's important to be surrounded by positivity, and hopefully even others who are on similar adventures. I think the environment at DBC is one where I will thrive.
  </p>
  <p class="body">
    Of course I'm scared. I'm afraid I won't be able to keep up. That I won't enjoy it. That I've bitten off more than I can chew. That maybe it was selfish of me to abandon a perfectly fine life to take a chance on something new.
  </p>
  <p class="body">
    But, screw that. I'm not willing to settle for fine. Fine is fine for some people. But I want amazing. I want to be proud of the work I've done at the end of every day. I want to be fulfilled. Inspired. One of the lucky ones who love what they do.
  </p>
  <p class="body">
    A few months ago I didn't even know there was such a thing as a developer bootcamp. Today, it consumes me. And tomorrow, well, I can't wait to find out.
