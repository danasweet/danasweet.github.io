  <h3 class="blogsubtitle">facing stereotype threat head on</h3>

    Stereotype threat is an interesting phenomenon. If you're not familiar, it's a situation in which an individual may perform worse for fear of confirming negative stereotypes about a social group they belong to. That's the official definition. I'm no psychologist, but I think that could even be broadened to include the risk of confirming any stereotype, not just negative ones. Women being seen as more nurturing than men may not be a negative view per se, but it could certainly place additional pressure on a nervous mother raising her first child.
  </p>
  <p class="body">
    The fact is, stereotypes are common in the world we live in. Not all of them are negative, but we do have preconceived notions about what we expect from people, perhaps based on their age, race, gender, occupation, where they live, or some other trait. I'm not sure if that's human nature or a consequence of repeated societal interactions that confirm our suspicions (a la confirmation bias), but it is indeed how we perceive each other.
  </p>
  <p class="body">
    Stereotype threat becomes a factor when these presumptions inhibit an individual from achieving success or their full potential because they don't want to confirm a stereotype. An example commonly referred to in many studies and articles states that stereotype threat can lead to African American students performing worse on the SAT, due to the stereotype that their race is less intelligent than others. And women have been known to score worse on a math exam if they know their work is being compared to men's, due to the stereotype that men are better at math.
  </p>
  <p class="body">
    It was intriguing to look into stereotype threat, though I think it's an incredibly difficult thing to quantify and don't believe it can be blamed for all or even most performance discrepancies. I can't say that I've ever outright faced stereotype threat, at least not at the same magnitude of the examples I listed earlier based on race and gender. But I have definitely let the pressures associated with preconceived notions affect my performance. I often feel an intense pressure to make a positive impression on people in any given task. For example, if I'm driving and have passengers who have never ridden with me before, I get nervous about driving well. God forbid they think I'm a bad driver! I've also been known to overcompensate for stereotypes: when I was younger, I would tip extra at restaurants so that I wouldn't perpetuate the stereotype that college kids tip poorly or not at all.
  </p>
  <p class="body">
    This internal pressure has been something I've faced a lot at DBC already, and I'm sure will continue to persist throughout the rest of the program. When pairing with someone new, I feel like I need to prove myself and ensure that my partner leaves our interaction with a positive view of me. It's not so much, "I hope I don't fail at programming because that will further prove that women aren't cut out for this industry." It's more, "I hope I don't fail at programming because people may think I'm unintelligent or not cut out for this industry." I'm not proud that I care so much about what others think, and I realize I'll have to get over that when I get onsite. I'll feel inadequate on a regular basis, and logically I know there's nothing wrong with that. Being humbled is the price and reward of learning a new skill at a ridiculously fast pace.
  </p>
  <p class="body">
    If I thought someone in my cohort was suffering from stereotype threat at DBC, I'm not sure what I would do. It's a very touchy subject, and not exactly one that you can tactfully address head-on without invitation. Taking the time to write this blog and self-reflect has been helpful for me, and I suppose simply being aware of the phenomenon will help us identify what we're feeling if we do encounter it. Perhaps it will help to remind each other occasionally that we're not expected to know everything--we're all going to succeed and fail many times over the course of this program, and that's just another obstacle on the list of things we're going to overcome.
