  <h4>Pairing Plights</h4>
  <p class="block-text">
    My first job after college was in a call center. I picked up a lot of valuable skills in that unglamorous job, and I also learned some things about myself. One of those things, perhaps a bit ironically: I <span class="bold">hate</span> the phone. I hate exchanging the initial pleasantries, the inevitable awkward silences injected throughout, and the, "<span class="italic">WELP</span>, I guess I'll let you go" that never comes quite soon enough. I rehearse what I will say before I call to make a reservation. I won't order a pizza or schedule an appointment if I can't do it online. I'm not sure why I experience so much anxiety with phone calls, but apparently I'm not alone (it appears to be a millenial thing). I sometimes hear the sound of a phone ringing in my nightmares. I. Hate. The phone.
  </p>
  <p class="block-text">
    If there's one thing that scares me more than the phone, it's video chats like Skype and Hangouts. It's exactly like talking on the phone, except the person can see you! I can't roll my eyes at what you said, or get by with a few "mmhmms" while otherwise spacing out? <span class="italic">How terrible!</span> The prospect of spending 9 remote weeks in video pairing sessions for Phase 0 at DBC really gave me some pause. But I refused to let my irrational fear stop me from committing to this experience. It was simply another challenge I'd have to overcome.
  </p>
  <p class="block-text">
    And 5 weeks in, it hasn't been much of an issue after all. I do experience some anxiety, but the pairing challenges are so immersive, soon enough I'm lost in the work and not at all worried about my phone performance.
  </p>
  <p class="block-text">
    Pairing has actually been kind of fun. In some cases, I've felt glad that I was working with someone, as they helped me understand a concept better, or the work just flowed easily between both of us. The majority of the time though, I'm finding I do work best alone. I think this is mostly because I find it hard to concentrate on thinking through a solution when someone else is speaking or even just watching me do something. I've found that I'm definitely an experimenter when it comes to getting my code to work, and at times it's draining to have to explain everything I'm doing to someone else.
  </p>
  <p class="block-text">
    I'm hopeful that when I have a better understanding of what a piece of code will do without having to test every single thing, I'll be able to work more efficiently with a peer. I know that it will likely be a large part of my future job responsibilities, and in a way I'm looking forward to that. Two heads are better than one, and it will be fun to be able to strategize with someone when we both know what we're doing. Presently, I feel most effective working solo, but I know that pairing is another skill that I'll hone over time.
  </p>
  <h4>Feedback Fervor</h4>
  <p class="block-text">
    DBC is huge on feedback, both giving and receiving. I've been pleased with the feedback I've received, as it's largely positive and makes me feel more confident in my pairing skills. Early on in Phase 0, I had a couple people say that I could have been more definitive in selecting a driver/navigator role, so now I think about my preference before I come into a challenge and let my partner know. For example, on my last pairing session I had already spent several hours pairing on a different challenge earlier in the day, so I asked my partner if he would mind doing most of the driving so I could focus more on thinking the problem through with my half-fried brain.
  </p>
  <p class="block-text">
    One piece of feedback pointed out that at times I have difficulties explaining myself, which I think stems from not being entirely confident in this new vernacular that I'm acquiring. Maybe I stumble over words or just generally am not communicating ideas and concepts effectively. That's now an issue that I'm aware of, so I make an effort to gather my thoughts before blurting out a bunch of nonsense.
  </p>
  <p class="block-text">
    For the most part, I've enjoyed giving feedback to others. It's nice to take a few minutes to reflect on the challenge and consider what went well, what didn't, and what you both could stand to improve. I do wish there was some leeway though, as sometimes I have a really tough time coming up with actionable (constructive) feedback. I'd say that's the most difficult thing for me when writing feedback--occasionally a session just goes very smoothly and there's nothing I'd want to change.
