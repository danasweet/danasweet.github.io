  <h3 class="blogsubtitle">why i'm embracing my inner Velma</h3>
  <p id="date">july 23, 2015</p>

  <p class="body">
    I was slightly bummed when I discovered the results of the <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">personal thinking style quiz</a>--"I'm...Concrete Sequential? But that's like, the nerdy one!"
  </p>
  <p class="body">
    Here are some adjectives that describe the Concrete Sequential (CS) learning style: <span class="italic">organized, structured, perfectionist, orderly, exact, efficient, systematic, practical, consistent.</span> Jinkies! Maybe I wasn't too far off when I compared myself to Scooby Doo's nerdiest member, Velma?
  </p>

    I like to think of myself as the opposite of buttoned-up. Words like free-spirit, imaginative, carefree, spontaneous, casual, and creative come to mind.
  </p>
  <p class="body">
    But the more I honestly examine myself and the way the past three weeks at Dev Bootcamp have played out, I'm coming to terms with the idea that yes, I am indeed a CS thinker. Here's why.
  </p>
  <p class="body">
    I love lists. I love checking things off lists. I'm one of those people who will make a list and add things to it that I've already completed, just so I can experience the satisfaction of checking it off. Confession: every week I take a screenshot of the DBC curriculum and save it in a notepad file. Then each time I finish a challenge, I cross it off the list. It's unnecessary and a little embarrassing, but it assures me that I'm on track, and seeing my progress visually helps me feel like I've accomplished something.
  </p>
  <p class="body">
    One article I read described this characteristic of a CS thinker: "A natural editor, can take anything and make it better." <span class="italic">Yes, child.</span> I'm not confident in many of my abilities, but I'm extremely sure of myself when it comes to editing. Be it spelling, grammar, visual layouts, photographs, advertisements--I'm constantly critiquing the media around me, mentally challenging myself to improve it (and cringing when the subject of scrutiny is a particularly bad offender). This trait actually led me to think I would enjoy a career in Marketing/Advertising, so I got a degree in it. Turns out I was wrong about enjoying Marketing, because:
  </p>
  <p class="body">
    CS thinkers "struggle with interpreting abstract ideas." A short stint in the Marketing world proved that I find the way Marketers speak (I refer to it as "Marketing Fluff") ridiculously frustrating. Like, how can you speak for 30 minutes without saying anything at all? Rambling on and on about optimizing, strategizing, synergy. (Does <span class="italic">anyone</span> even know what synergy means?!) This is not to say that I can't appreciate a deep, philosophical discussion. Rather, that I prefer logical ideas over abstract ones. I'd rather speak English than Fluff.
  </p>
  <p class="body">
    So okay, fine. I'm a perfectionist. I prefer order over chaos. I get excited about completing a task wholly and correctly. That doesn't make me a nerd, it makes me a Concrete Sequential thinker--they are not one and the same! But what does all this actually mean?
  </p>
    <p class="body">
    For me, it's about understanding and embracing the way I learn, so that I can maximize my time at DBC. This program is so much different than any learning institution I've ever been a part of. At university, my main priority was to get good grades, and ultimately get the degree that would serve as my "ticket" to employment. I didn't so much care about learning or absorbing what was being taught. I just had to memorize enough to pass the test.
  </p>
  <p class="body">
    DBC is the complete opposite. There are no tests, no grades, no degrees. The <span class="italic">only</span> reason I'm here is to learn. That's liberating, but it also means there's no easy way through this program. If I don't understand something, I can't just guess my way through a multiple-choice exam. I have to put in the work to really learn it. And luckily, I think being a Concrete Sequential thinker will aid me in that challenge.
  </p>
  <p class="body">
    I know now that being a CS thinker doesn't mean I'm not that creative spirit I'd always hoped I was. It just means my brain absorbs information best (or, in Marketing Fluff, my brain is optimized) under certain conditions. And now it's my responsibility to ensure that I create these conditions for myself, so that I can get the most out of the next 4 months.
  </p>
  <p class="body">
    Now, please excuse me as I go cross this blog off my to-do list.
