  <h2 class="blogtitle">Ruby vs JavaScript</h2>
  <h3 class="blogsubtitle">who iterated better?</h3>
  <p id="date">august 23, 2015</p>
  <br>
  <p class="body">
    My first impressions of JavaScript are mixed. Ruby spoiled me with many shortcuts. She carries out many processes "under the hood," and doesn't need a lot of step-by-step instruction. JavaScript is a much more literal language. You must spell out exactly what you want from it.
  </p>
  <p class="body">
    This can be illustrated in the simple case of iterating over an array. Ruby has numerous methods for iteration, but the most basic and commonly used is each. <span class="code">each</span> calls a given block of code once for each element in the array. The code below will print the double of each number in the array (on separate lines, thanks to <span class="code">puts</span>).
  </p>
  <p class="codeblock">
    a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]<br>
    a.each {|i| puts i*2}
  </p>
  <p class="body">
    JavaScript doesn't have as many looping functions as Ruby has looping methods. This JavaScript <span class="code">for loop</span> has the same result as Ruby's <span class="code">each</span> method above:
  </p>
  <p class="codeblock">
    a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];<br>
    for (var i=0; i < a.length; i++) {<br>
      console.log(a[i]*2);<br>
    }
  </p>
  <p class="body">
    Comparing the two, Ruby looks more like English, while JavaScript looks like what flashes by the screen when a hacker is mad-coding in the movies. Using a for loop to iterate means defining 3 things between the parentheses:<br>
    1. Defining a counting variable and giving it a value<br>
    2. Similar to a <span class="code">while</span> statement, this section defines the condition of the loop. In this case, looping will continue while our counting variable is less than the number of values in the array.<br>
    3. Incrementing our counting variable. This is done after each loop has been executed.<br>
    After the parentheses, whatever is between the curly brackets is the code block that will be executed upon each loop, same as in Ruby.
  </p>
  <p class="body">
    Ruby didn't need a counting variable or to be told how many loops to make. Basically everything that's between the parentheses in JavaScript's <span class="code">for loop</span> is what Ruby is doing for you implicitly in the <span class="code">each</span> method.
  </p>
  <h4>tl;dr</h4>
  <p class="body">
    Ruby makes iterating easy with a lot of built-in methods that automate processes for you, while JavaScript likes to explicitly be told what to do. For me, this means Ruby is more convenient, but JavaScript makes sure I fully understand what each and every piece of my code is doing. <span class="italic">Ding, ding!</span> I'm declaring this round a tie!
